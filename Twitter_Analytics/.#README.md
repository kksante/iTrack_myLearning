This Project Reads tweeter feeds and analyzes the feeds.
The run.sh file will compile and run python modules using a an input
file named tweets.txt and produced two output files named ft1.txt and
ft2.txt.

You can modify tweets.txt by adding more lines to the file or by
replacing the file with a new file of any size which must be named
tweets.txt. Note the the program reads this file line by line.

The output files contain two different sets of information
1) ft1.txt contains the words tweeted in the tweets.txt and the number
of times each word is tweeted listed under the frequency column

2) ft2.txt contains the running median of the number of unique words
tweeted.

The python modules written to implement this feature use(import) two
generic python modules for manipulating the files.

module 1: sys is used pass information from command promt (in this
case shell script) to the python module for this feature

module 2: os is used to manipulate files and directories. Needed as
all the files need for this feature do no reside in one directory but
have a parent directory and sub-directories.

Execute run.sh for your file named tweets.txt and then check
tweet_output for the output files containing the results.
